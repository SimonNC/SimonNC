* **Business-Oriented**: Experience in data-driven finance, operations, and e-commerce environments, translating technical metrics into strategic recommendations.
* **Engineering Mindset**: I treat data as a product, implementing multi-layered architectures (`staging` → `marts`) and CI/CD workflows to ensure data quality.

### 🚀 Featured Data Projects


#### 1. [Olist E-commerce: End-to-End BI Solution](https://github.com/SimonNC/olist-data-analysis)
* **Business Problem**: Quantify the impact of logistics performance on customer satisfaction to reduce negative reviews.
* **Approach**: Built a full pipeline from raw CSVs to interactive dashboards. Conducted deep EDA with Python to identify the "25-30 day delivery" threshold where satisfaction collapses.
* **Tech**: Python for cleaning/EDA, Parquet for performance, and Power BI for executive storytelling using a Star-Schema model.
* **Impact**: Identified that deliveries exceeding 30 days generate 64% of negative reviews. Recommended proactive alerts at the 20-day mark and region-specific SLA adjustments.

#### 2. [Analytics Engineering with dbt & DuckDB](https://github.com/SimonNC/olist-dbt-duckdb)
* **Business Problem**: Fragmented raw data led to inconsistent KPI reporting. The goal was to build a modern, SQL-centric data warehouse architecture.
* **Approach**: Implemented a layered dbt project (`staging`, `intermediate`, `marts`) using DuckDB. Focused on mastering data grains and separating technical IDs from business entities.
* **Tech & Quality**: SQL-only transformations, dbt Core, Data Contracts (dbt tests), and GitHub Actions for automated CI/CD and documentation.
* **Impact**: Delivered "BI-Ready" marts for Revenue and Retention. Established a Single Source of Truth where data quality is enforced by automated tests, reducing manual audit time.
